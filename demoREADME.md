  ## Description

  *The what, why, and how:*

  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. We can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This command-line application will dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquirer package. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

  ## Installation
    
  *Installation instructions:*
    
  If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any. Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.
  
  ## Usage
      
  *Usage information:*
      
  Your usage documentation is probably the most important part of your README, without it very few people are going to trawl through your code to get it working. Depending on the kind of project youâ€™re writing a README for, this section could take many forms.
  
  ## Contributing
      
  *Contribution guidelines:*
      
  This mostly will be useful if you are developing an open-source project that you will need other developers to contribute to. You will want to add guidelines to let them know how they can contribute to your project.
  
  ## Tests
      
  *Test instructions:*
      
  Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide code examples and how to run them. This will help show that you are certain and confident that your project will work without any challenges, which will give other people confidence in it, too.

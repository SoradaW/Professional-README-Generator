  # Readme generator

  ## Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. We can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This command-line application will dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquirer package. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
